`Description`
=
This project is a virtual creation of a TI-84 model graphing calculator. Although
this design isn't 100% like the original, this 
design includes the basic features and functions of a physical graphing calculator
from basic arithmetic functions algebraic calculations. One main goal of this 
project was to give a widely used tool in many work spaces further mobility and convenience
by implementing the functions of a real calculator to a virtual device.

`Features`
=
* Basic Arithmetic Functions
* Other Mathematical Functions (logarithms, trigonometry)
* Equation Graphing
